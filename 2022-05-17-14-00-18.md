# Higher Order Directives

Sooo, robocop has the Asimov style directives, right?

They're the ideas that he always checks against when doing anything.

It's interesting that they're worded kind of broadly. There are no goals, no measurements or outcomes.

But they're still the best thing he's got, right? That's the whole story, is his relationship with how to negotiate those ideas.

The ideas are the broadest sense of organization the transhuman cyborg has. He barely sleeps, eats, or rests, really. No sex organs and even still, the pleasure centers of his brain are gone. Drugs and stimulus of any kind have less impact on him than bullets. 

He navigates a whole world of treachery and danger based on his relationship with the directives.

What are our directives? Where do they come from? Those ideas that we grapple with the most.

How do we translate the directives to our situations? How do we identify when we're in conflict with them? How do we utilize them for ourselves?

Murphy becoming a machine reflects the society reorganizing. As the city seeks to reorganize policing, so does it reorganize the police as individuals. Picking and choosing which parts it does or doesn't need on behalf of the individual.
